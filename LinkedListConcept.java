		 * implementation of doubly linked list which can be used as both queue and set
		 * elements in linked list is called nodes
		 * each nodes consisting of three parts
		 * references to previous element, value of element ,references to next element
		 * insertion and removal are faster in linked list when compare to arraylist
		 * retrieval operation is slower
		 * bcoz linked list is not a type of random access 
		 * so it will traverse from begin to end to retrieve the element
		 * 
		 * iterable---collection(abstract collection) --queue--Deque
		 * 											  --list(abstract list) --abstract sequential list-----LinkedList
		 * 
		 * insert from head
		 * addFirst(element)
		 * offerFirst(element)
		 * 
		 * insert from middle
		 * add(index,element)
		 * addAll(index,collection)
		 *

		 * getLast()

		 * 
		 * linkedlist contains duplicate and null values
		 * linkedlist can be used as arraylist ,queue single double linked list
		 * linkedlist can be used as stack .it has methods pop() push()
